# FPV-3D-print
Collection of STL for drones. All STL files are from manufacturer, designers
or creators (name is published). All STL are published as "free" to use under their
creative commons license and not intended for commercial use. 
Anyone can add stl files with pull request. 

Notes:
Some STL files are as published, but to get good results it is suggested to change position, 
example a standoff is printed well in vertical position enabling support and brim.
Consider rotating element for better print results and less filament usage. Enjoy.
